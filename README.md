I am batching the dataset during preprocessing. I thought maybe I could specify batch_size in model.fit() as well, but I tried it and it didn't work.
I also tried to remove some layers, but it did not work either. So there must be a problem with the code. What is strange is that it worked before, even with all the layers and everything.
